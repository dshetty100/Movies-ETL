# Movies-ETL

## Overview of the Project
In this project we write a code to create a function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database. 

1) In file 'ETL_function_test.ipynb' we create an ETL function to read the three data files.
2) In file 'ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb' we extract and transform the Wikipedia data 
3) In file 'ETL_create_database.ipynb' we extract and transform the Kaggle data
4) In file 'ETL_create_database.ipynb' we create the movie database
